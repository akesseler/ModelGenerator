    <h1>Adjustment</h1>
    <p>
        The settings of <em>Adjustment</em> are used to control how classes and their members
        (properties and/or fields) are named during code generation. All possible options are
        shown below.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Enable usage of adjustment feature.</dt>
        <dd>
            Any additional class and member name modification is skipped in case of this checkbox
            is unchecked. Otherwise automatic class and member name adjustment takes place.
        </dd>
        <dt>Casing Format</dt>
        <dd>
            This selection box allows to choose how class and member renaming should be applied.
            Possible values are shown below.
            <table style="margin-top: 0.5em">
                <tr>
                    <td style="padding-right: 1em"><em>Unmodified</em></td>
                    <td>
                        A renaming of classes and members does not take place and each descriptor
                        remains unchanged.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="padding-right: 1em"><em>PascalCase</em></td>
                    <td>
                        The naming convention for <em>Pascal Case</em> is applied. This means
                        that the first letter of each class and member name (property or field)
                        is converted into upper case.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="padding-right: 1em"><em>CamelCase</em></td>
                    <td>
                        The naming convention for <em>Camel Case</em> is applied. This means
                        that the first letter of each class and member name (property or field)
                        is converted into lower case.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </dd>
        <dt>Member Prefix</dt>
        <dd>
            A string to be prepended to each member name (property or field). A prefix is actually
            only useful for fields. Please note that each prefix is only applied after the naming
            convention rules have been applied. Furthermore, please be aware that a prefix is applied
            as it is, including special characters, whitespaces, etc.
        </dd>
        <dt>Member Suffix</dt>
        <dd>
            A string to be appended to each member name (property or field). A suffix is actually
            only useful for fields. Please note that each suffix is only applied after the naming
            convention rules have been applied. Furthermore, please be aware that a suffix is applied
            as it is, including special characters, whitespaces, etc.
        </dd>

    <h1>Replacements</h1>
    <p>
        Value replacement takes place during model import and is necessary to ensure type
        dependent properties and fields. In addition, the procedure of value replacement
        is case sensitive and replaces each fitting word.
    </p>
    <p>
        Put each value to be replaced that can occur in a source model (JSON or XML) into
        the left column and put the replacement into its corresponding right column cell.
    </p>
    <p>
        The right cell should contain a typed value, for example strings with double quotes,
        integer numbers with just zero, floating point number with zero&ndash;dot&ndash;zero,
        date and/or time values with a particular date and/or time, and so on.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        The source model may contain the literal &ldquo;integer&rdquo;. But this literal
        cannot be converted into any valid type, except string. Therefore, each literal
        &ldquo;integer&rdquo; should be replaced by &ldquo;0&rdquo;, which indeed indicates
        an integer data type.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another example is the literal &ldquo;number&rdquo; that may represent a decimal value.
        In such a case it would be useful to replace each &ldquo;number&rdquo; by &ldquo;0.0&rdquo;
        instead.
